# Perplexity AI Python Scripts

A collection of simple Python scripts that use the [Perplexity AI API](https://docs.perplexity.ai/) for different tasks.

## What's Inside?

This project has two main scripts:

1. **Batch Search (`main.py`)**: This script can run many searches on Perplexity at once. It's useful for gathering a lot of information quickly on different topics.
2. **Free Fire Code Finder (`ff_redeem.py`)**: This script automatically searches for the latest Free Fire redeem codes for the current day.

## Features

- **Asynchronous**: Uses Python's `asyncio` to run searches fast and efficiently.
- **Batch Processing**: The `main.py` script processes searches in batches to respect API rate limits.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple to set up and run.
